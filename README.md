# iPhone Identifier

A local web app that walks a repair technician through questions about a
phone's visible characteristics until it identifies the iPhone model on the
bench. Covers iPhone 8 through the iPhone 17 generation.

Full requirements, data model, and roadmap: **[SPEC.md](SPEC.md)**.

## Requirements

Node 20.19+ (developed on 22.20.0).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite serves on all interfaces, so the dev server is reachable from a phone or
tablet on the same network.

## Scripts

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Type-check and build to `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm test` | Run the Vitest suite once |
| `npm run test:watch` | Vitest in watch mode |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check without emitting |

The build uses relative asset paths, so `dist/` can be copied to a device and
opened directly. The app has no backend and no runtime network dependency.

## Layout

```
SPEC.md          the specification — read this first
reference/       Phase 1 research output: sourced model facts and images
src/data/        attribute definitions, questions, the model matrix
src/engine/      pure TypeScript identification logic (no React)
src/diagrams/    SVG components illustrating answer options
src/ui/          screens
```

## Status

Phase 0 — scaffolding complete. Phase 1 (sourced data collection) is next and
runs in its own session; see SPEC.md §10.
